    <p><ent>U</ent><br/>
        <hw>U</hw> <pr>(?)</pr>, <def>the twenty-first letter of the English alphabet, is a cursive form of the letter V, with which it was formerly used interchangeably, both letters being then used both as vowels and consonants. U and V are now, however, differentiated, U being used only as a vowel or semivowel, and V only as a consonant. The true primary vowel sound of U, in Anglo-Saxon, was the sound which it still retains in most of the languages of Europe, that of long <xex>oo</xex>, as in <xex>tool</xex>, and short <xex>oo</xex>, as in <xex>wood</xex>, answering to the French <xex>ou</xex> in <xex>tour</xex>. Etymologically U is most closely related to <xex>o</xex>, <xex>y</xex> (vowel), <xex>w</xex>, and <xex>v</xex>; as in <xex>two</xex>, d<xex>u</xex>et, d<xex>y</xex>ad, t<xex>w</xex>ice; t<xex>o</xex>p, t<xex>u</xex>ft; s<xex>o</xex>p, s<xex>u</xex>p; a<xex>u</xex>spice, a<xex>v</xex>iary. See <er>V</er>, also <er>O</er> and <er>Y</er>.</def><br/>
