        <p><ent>U</ent><br/>
            <hw>U</hw> <pr>(?)</pr>, <def>the twenty-first letter of the English alphabet, is a cursive form of the letter V, with which it was formerly used interchangeably, both letters being then used both as vowels and consonants. U and V are now, however, differentiated, U being used only as a vowel or semivowel, and V only as a consonant. The true primary vowel sound of U, in Anglo-Saxon, was the sound which it still retains in most of the languages of Europe, that of long <xex>oo</xex>, as in <xex>tool</xex>, and short <xex>oo</xex>, as in <xex>wood</xex>, answering to the French <xex>ou</xex> in <xex>tour</xex>. Etymologically U is most closely related to <xex>o</xex>, <xex>y</xex> (vowel), <xex>w</xex>, and <xex>v</xex>; as in <xex>two</xex>, d<xex>u</xex>et, d<xex>y</xex>ad, t<xex>w</xex>ice; t<xex>o</xex>p, t<xex>u</xex>ft; s<xex>o</xex>p, s<xex>u</xex>p; a<xex>u</xex>spice, a<xex>v</xex>iary.

See <er>Anti-</er>.]</ety> <def>An inseparable verbal prefix or particle. It is prefixed: <sd>(a)</sd> To verbs to express the contrary, and not the simple negative, of the action of the verb to which it is prefixed; as in <xex>un</xex>bend, <xex>un</xex>coil, <xex>un</xex>do, <xex>un</xex>fold. <sd>(b)</sd> To nouns to form verbs expressing privation of the thing, quality, or state expressed by the noun, or separation from it; as in <xex>un</xex>child, <xex>un</xex>sex. Sometimes particles and participial adjectives formed with this prefix coincide in form with compounds of the negative prefix <xex>un-</xex> (see 2d <er>Un-</er>); as in <xex>un</xex>done (from <xex>un</xex>do), meaning unfastened, ruined; and <xex>un</xex>done (from 2d <xex>un-</xex> and <xex>done</xex>) meaning not done, not finished. <xex>Un-</xex> is sometimes used with an intensive force merely; as in <xex>un</xex>loose.</def><br/>
